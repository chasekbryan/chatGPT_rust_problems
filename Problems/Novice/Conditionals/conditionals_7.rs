// Type: Conditionals
// Difficulty: Novice (Level 1)
//
// Lesson:
// Rust's match statement allows you to compare a value against multiple patterns, simplifying conditional logic.
// It is similar to `switch` in other languages but more powerful.
//
// Instructions:
// 1. Declare a variable `day` with an integer representing the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).
// 2. Use a `match` statement to print the corresponding name of the weekday.
// 3. Include a default case that prints "Invalid day".
//
// Hints:
// - A `match` statement compares one value against multiple possible patterns.
// - Each pattern is followed by `=>` and the corresponding code block.
// - Use `_` to handle all cases that aren't explicitly matched.

fn main() {
  // TODO: Declare an integer variable `day`.

  // TODO: Write a match statement for the variable `day`.
