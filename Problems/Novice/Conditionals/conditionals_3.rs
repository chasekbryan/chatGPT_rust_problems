// Type: Conditionals
// Difficulty: Novice (Level 1)
//
// Lesson:
// Conditional logic can be combined with boolean operations like AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) to form more complex conditions.
//
// Instructions:
// 1. Declare two integer variables, `age` and `height_cm`.
// 2. Use a conditional statement to determine if someone can ride a rollercoaster:
//    - They must be at least 12 years old AND at least 140 centimeters tall.
//    - Print "You can ride!" if the conditions are met, otherwise print "Sorry, you can't ride.".
//
// Hints:
// - Use `&&` to require multiple conditions to be true at once.
// - Make sure both conditions are correctly combined in your `if` statement.

fn main() {
  // TODO: Declare variables `age` and `height_cm`.

  // TODO: Write a conditional statement using AND (`&&`).
}
