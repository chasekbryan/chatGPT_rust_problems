// Type: Functions
// Difficulty: Novice (Level 1)
//
// Lesson:
// Functions can call each other to break problems into smaller steps. 
// This makes programs easier to understand and maintain.
//
// Instructions:
// 1. Define a function named `double` that takes an `i32` and returns twice its value.
// 2. Define another function named `double_plus_five` that:
//    - Takes an `i32`,
//    - Calls `double` on it,
//    - Adds 5 to the result,
//    - Returns the final value.
// 3. In `main`, call `double_plus_five` with 6 and print the result.
//
// Hints:
// - To call a function from inside another function, just use its name and pass the argument.
// - Addition is performed with `+`.

fn main() {
    // TODO: Call double_plus_five with 6 and print the result
}
