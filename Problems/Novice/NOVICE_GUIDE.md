# Novice Rust Learning Guide

This guide is designed to help you navigate through the **novice** set of Rust exercises. It follows a progressive approach, starting with the fundamentals and gradually increasing in difficulty. Each exercise contains a problem prompt, a lesson explaining the concept, clear instructions, and hints to guide your coding practice.

## Suggested Learning Strategy

1. **Start with the Basics:**
   Begin with the **Variables** topic to understand how data is stored and manipulated in Rust. This is foundational and will be used in nearly every exercise afterward.
   
2. **Gradually Build Concepts:**
   Move on to the **Arithmetic** exercises next. This will help you understand how to work with numbers in Rust, including both integer and floating-point types.

3. **Learn Conditional Logic:**
   Next, tackle the **Conditionals** topic. Understanding `if`/`else` statements is crucial for controlling the flow of your program based on different conditions.

4. **Practice Loops:**
   After mastering conditionals, practice using **Loops**. Rust provides `for` and `while` loops, which are essential for iterating over collections and repeating actions.

5. **Understand Functions:**
   The **Functions** section will help you understand how to structure your code and break it into reusable blocks of code. Functions are an essential part of Rust programming.

6. **Explore Tuples and Arrays:**
   Tuples and Arrays are basic data structures in Rust. In the **Tuples and Arrays** exercises, you will practice accessing, destructuring, and using these structures effectively.

7. **Manipulate Strings and Slices:**
   The **Strings and Slices** exercises will introduce you to basic string manipulation and slicing techniques in Rust. This is important for handling text in your programs.

8. **Work with Collections:**
   Finally, practice working with **Collections** such as `Vec` (dynamic arrays) in Rust. Collections are vital for storing and managing groups of data.

## Order of Learning

Here is the suggested order in which to approach the exercises in the novice category:

1. **Variables** (Up to 20 exercises)
2. **Arithmetic** (Up to 20 exercises)
3. **Conditionals** (Up to 20 exercises)
4. **Loops** (Up to 20 exercises)
5. **Functions** (Up to 20 exercises)
6. **Tuples and Arrays** (Up to 20 exercises)
7. **Strings and Slices** (Up to 20 exercises)
8. **Collections** (Up to 20 exercises)

By following this sequence, you'll progressively master the core concepts of Rust and be well-prepared for more advanced topics in the future.

## Tips for Learning

- **Practice Consistently:** Try to complete one exercise at a time before moving to the next. This will help you solidify your understanding and prevent overwhelm.
- **Use Hints Sparingly:** If you're stuck, refer to the hints in the problem files, but avoid looking for the solution right away. The goal is to learn by solving problems on your own.
- **Write Your Own Code:** Don't just copy the code you find in the problem files. Write the code yourself to gain hands-on experience.
- **Check Solutions Separately:** After completing a set of problems, you can check the solution directory for reference. But always try to work through the problems without looking at solutions immediately.
- **Build on Previous Knowledge:** Each new topic will build upon the previous one. Make sure you understand the basics before moving on to more advanced concepts.

## Conclusion

Following this guide, you'll gradually develop the necessary skills to move from a novice to an intermediate Rust programmer. Stick to the exercises, practice consistently, and don't hesitate to revisit earlier problems to reinforce your understanding.
