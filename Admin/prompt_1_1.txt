okay so we have a directory called chatGPT_rust_problems. we are going to work
on these one at a time and the end result will be a mass of problems leveled
from novice, to neophyte to adept etcetera using this name scheme. each problem
will have a designed comment detailing what kind of problem this is and it's
difficulty level. we will start from the very very basics to learn rust with
most of the problems being written out in the rust code itself. we will only do
one at a time, so you will generate a new problem that slightly increases in
difficulty from the last one when i tell you to. just one at a time. the
problems should be named for the concept with a short commented lesson on the
problem first so that it can be solved with the knowledge gained thus far. the
problems will be named their type and then the problem number in this format
(TYPE..1.rs) okay lets go. first problem
